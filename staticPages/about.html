          Julia Ting. Ah. What a pal. What a gal. \n <br>
          I’m her. That’s me. I love ultimate Frisbee! \n <br>
          I’m left handed, and I try to be candid. \n <br>
          If you need some proof, here’s the truth: \n <br>
          Computer Science is a guy I would date. \n <br>
          Love at first sight, it was pretty much fate. \n <br>
          He never lies, and rewards all my trys, \n <br>
          I fell into his catch after he told me I was exception(al). \n <br>
          break; \n <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          You’ll notice I like to have fun, \n <br>
          and throw the frequent pun, \n <br>
          and since this poem is done, \n <br>
          I’ll probably go eat a ton.  <br>
